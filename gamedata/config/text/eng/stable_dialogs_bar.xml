 <text>I need a strong gravitational artifact..</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="gravartsmnb2_1"> 
 <text>Alright. Give me the device and the money.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="gravartsmnb2_2"> 
 <text>...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="gravartsmnb2_3"> 
 <text>And it's done! Here is the artifact.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="gravartsmnb_0"> 
 <text>What kind of artifacts do you have here?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="gravartsmnb_1"> 
 <text>Yes, I have a special device... It's for artifact transmutation: if you take this device and put the required artifacts inside it it will turn them into a new artifact, but it currently has only a recipe for a strong gravitational artifact. I can provide the ingredients for the conversion; you only need the device itself and 5000 rubles.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="gravartsmnb_2"> 
 <text>After I get the artifacts?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="gravartsmnb_3"> 
 <text>That's right.</text> 
 </string> 








 <string id="stgraugdhs_0"> 
 <text>Mmh, I need something..</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="stgraugdhs_1"> 
 <text>Yeah? What do you need?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="stgraugdhs_2"> 
 <text>The gravity-powered zip gun. I think only you can make it...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="stgraugdhs_3"> 
 <text>Yeah, okay. I need a specific artifact - one of those stronger gravity-based artifacts. Bring it here, and we'll talk.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="ribkaprstugdhs_0"> 
 <text>I've got the artifact.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="ribkaprstugdhs_1"> 
 <text>For the zip gun? Alright, let me put this together.. there you go.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="ribkaprstugdhs_2"> 
 <text>...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="ribkaprstugdhs_3"> 
 <text>Take your weapon and go.</text>

 <string id="grartgraugdhs_0"> 
 <text>Mmh, I need something. I need a gravity-based artfiact.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="grartgraugdhs_1"> 
 <text>We have it, and we can give it to you, but you need to give me a reason for me to give it to you.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="grartgraugdhs_2"> 
 <text>What do you want?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="grartgraugdhs_3"> 
 <text>The artifact I need - one of those stronger gravity-based artifacts. Bring it here, and we'll talk. It'll be a fair trade.</text>

 <text>I have a question about the artifact you need.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="ribk22prstugdhs_1">

 <string id="zzgmetalkisghtikz_0"> 
 <text>Thank you, stalker.</text> 
 </string> 

 <string id="zzzzsngtfrghtikz_0"> 
 <text>Oh, shit... what happened to him?</text> 
 </string> 


 <string id="zzzzsnikz_0"> 
 <text>Hello.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zzzzsnikz_1"> 
 <text>Hi. Did you manage to find out anything about the missing group?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zzzzsnikz_2"> 
 <text>As you expected, the group was taken prisoner by Sin. I managed to save them.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zzzzsnikz_01"> 
 <text>Let me check something.. I'm detecting their signal on my PDA. I think they're already here. Thank you, stalker. You did great! As gratitude, I'll give you a car for free. It'll be near the bunker. Thank you again.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="prstugdhs_0"> 
 <text>I found what you asked for.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="prstugdhs_1"> 
 <text>Really? Well, they're lucky you came by, haha.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="prstugdhs_2"> 
 <text>Can you release them?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="prstugdhs_3"> 
 <text>Yes. We'll let them go soon. We need to do something with them before we let them go.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="stugdhs_0"> 
 <text>Who do you have in the next room?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="stugdhs_1"> 
 <text>Why do you care? We've got a group of scientists in there. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time, heh-heh. They came just in time for our ritual. The heads of those scientists will come in handy.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="stugdhs_2"> 
 <text>Wait, you want their heads? No, no, that's not good. I need them alive. I'll buy them from you.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="stugdhs_3"> 
 <text>'Buy'? We don't need money. If you really need them alive, bring us three heads and they'll be set free.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="hhhnikz_0"> 
 <text>Are there any well-paid jobs?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="hhhnikz_1"> 
 <text>Mmh, yes. About a month ago, we sent four teams to different corners of the Zone for research. The first group died in the Cordon, somewhere around the tower. You discovered the remains of the second group at Shining Path. Another was killed here at the pillbox near the lake. We don't know much about the fourth one.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="hhhnikz_2"> 
 <text>Go on.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="hhhnikz_01"> 
 <text>All I know is they disappeared at Silent Hills. Do you know what kind of people live there? Sinners. They're real psychos. I do accept the possibility that they're at their base, and the possibility that they're still alive. If you make it to there, try to help our group. They're the only employees we have left. If you help us, we'll give you a special reward.</text> 
 </string> 






 <string id="silgrav_0"> 
 <text>Hello. Barkeep sent me. He has business.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="silgrav_1"> 
 <text>Barkeep sent you on business? We've got some "business" too. Listen up - if you're gonna do business with us, get me one of those stronger gravitational artifacts.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="silgrav_2"> 
 <text>I'll try. Where can you find those artifacts?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="silgrav_01"> 
 <text>Near gravity anomalies. It's not your first day in the Zone, is it? After you sort things out, go look for one.</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="psilgrav_0"> 
 <text>Take this artifact.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="psilgrav_1"> 
 <text>Well done, stalker. I think we can work with you.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="psilgrav_2"> 
 <text>Can we get to my business?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="psilgrav_01"> 
 <text>Yes, certainly.</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="yaabneayb_0"> 
 <text>Do you have any other work?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="yaabneayb_1"> 
 <text>Have you ever heard of the 'Sinners'? They're truly terrifying - you'll know what I mean when you first run into them. It's rumored that they're holed up in the Silent Hills somewhere. People say that their leader isn't even human, and he's supposedly one of the first in stalkers who made it to the Zone. In short, this is one of the oldest groups in the Zone: they've been here since it appeared. Now, I know that at their base in the Hills, there is a vault with various secret documents inside it. I need you to go there and get me a specific document from that vault. Do you think you can do this for me?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="yaabneayb_2"> 
 <text>I'll try, but I can't promise anything.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="yaabneayb_01"> 
 <text>Thank you. Be careful with those Sinners.</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="mnb_0"> 
 <text>Here, take the file.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="mnb_1"> 
 <text>You were able to get the document from the vault at the Sinner's base? Good job, stalker. This will really help us in learning more about the Zone.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="mnb_2"> 
 <text>What about the payment?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="mnb_01"> 
 <text>Yes, certainly. Give me a minute... Here's your money.</text> 
 </string> 





 <string id="ggzxroz_0"> 
 <text>Look, I’ve got something. Would this fake eye be of interest to you?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="ggzxroz_1"> 
 <text>Hmm, a rare thing in the Zone. I'll buy it for 500 rubles.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="ggzxroz_2"> 
 <text>Here, take it</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="ggzxroz_01"> 
 <text>Interesting stuff. Thank you.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="zxrpozsskayb_0">

 <string id="zxrpozsskayb_1"> 
 <text>What? What do you mean?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zxrpozsskayb_2"> 
 <text>I found your brother. He's dead. He's in the underground lab at Dark Valley.</text> 
 </string>

 <text>Stalker... Could you leave me alone, please? Thank you...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zxrpozsskayb_5">

 <string id="svdodddkz_0"> 
 <text>You're from the Professor?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="svdodddkz_1"> 
 <text>Yes. I'm interested in something...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="svdodddkz_2"> 
 <text>You're interested in something? So am I. Those egghead bastards placed a radiation field from their damn psy-rig right in front of our base. Some of our comrades say that the radiation field is expanding, and it seems it'll reach our base soon. Those eggheads have some weird shit going on... We've traced the source to a house that's left to one of the roads at Silent Hills. I don't want to send any of my men there. The radiation there is so intense that all the grass has faded and evaporated. Go there and see if you can turn that shit off. We'll talk afterwards.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="svdodddkz_01"> 
 <text>Damn... okay, I'll do it.</text> 
 </string> 





 <string id="dodddkz_0"> 
 <text>Hello. Are you the Doctor?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dodddkz_1"> 
 <text>Yes. I knew you were coming..</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dodddkz_2"> 
 <text>I have a few questions.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dodddkz_01"> 
 <text>Hold on a moment, I need your help first, then I'll help you with your questions. Listen carefully: a stalker wandered into the swamp and he's already spent half a day at the fishing lodge. I'm worried about him. Bring him here, but don't let him inside. Let him sit on the porch. Grab the first-aid kit from the stove, you might need it. Also, you'll need to take something from him as payment for my services.</text>
 </string> 



 <string id="mzdodddkz_0"> 
 <text>Hey, how are you?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="mzdodddkz_1"> 
 <text>Who's there? A stalker? I need help. I.. came from the Radar. The radiation there.. is intense...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="mzdodddkz_2"> 
 <text>There's a doctor nearby. I think he can help you.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="mzdodddkz_01"> 
 <text>A doctor?! Let's go...</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="pdodddkz_0"> 
 <text>Doctor, I left him on your porch. He's halfway gone. He says he came from the Radar.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pdodddkz_1"> 
 <text>Let him rest there for a while. Go to him and find out where he's from, what faction he's with, and take a careful look at his equipment.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pdodddkz_2"> 
 <text>Ok, got it.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pdodddkz_01"> 
 <text>Wait, there's more. After you're done with the stalker, you need to go see a trader. His name is Toad, he recently settled at the Hills. You need to pick up a strange-looking container; it looks something like a small refrigerator. You'll need to bring it here. You'll get free treatment if you do this for me.</text> 
 </string> 


 <string id="dopdodddkz_0"> 
 <text>Who are you and where are you from?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dopdodddkz_1"> 
 <text>Me? I'm Leary. I was part of a group of stalkers that was going from Shining Path to the Radar, and we decided to take a shortcut at the old military warehouses. But something's wrong there... If you go there, your brain gets cooked inside your skull. I don't remember how I got here. I recall seeing the destroyed bridge and having to swim...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dopdodddkz_2"> 
 <text>I see you have nothing interesting on you. You've got a gun and a radio... The Doctor needs something, so he can take you in. He'll sell one of your things for money for medicine, while I'll be taking the other as payment.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dopdodddkz_01"> 
 <text>Yeah, okay...</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="jopdodddkz_0"> 
 <text>Hello, Toad. Doctor sent me.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="jopdodddkz_1"> 
 <text>You came from the swamps, eh? You're a tough one, Messer. I'll be honest, I didn't think you would last three days in the Zone, but here you are. Alright, here's the thing that Doctor wants.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="jopdodddkz_2"> 
 <text>Damn.. how much does this thing weigh?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="jopdodddkz_01"> 
 <text>Heh, did you think that it was made out of feathers? If you can't carry it, throw your stuff into the storage box, you can come back for it later. Don't worry about it, I'll keep your stuff safe.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="hjopdodddkz_0"> 
 <text>Doctor, I brought what you asked for.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="hjopdodddkz_1"> 
 <text>Good. I need you to do one more errand for me, and then I'll answer your questions.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="hjopdodddkz_2"> 
 <text>Alright...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="hjopdodddkz_01"> 
 <text>The stalker is getting better. He said that he came from the city with a group of people. Maybe he's a member of some faction? Go to Shining Path and ask around the local clan, maybe they know something.</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="zzhjopdodddkz_0"> 
 <text>Listen, have you ever heard about Leary?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zzhjopdodddkz_1"> 
 <text>Who? Ohhh, that guy. Yeah I know him. He disappeared along with a group at the Radar.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zzhjopdodddkz_2"> 
 <text>He's alive and currently is at the swamp Doctor.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zzhjopdodddkz_01"> 
 <text>Goddamn... and we already said goodbye to him, and now this... That's some good news! Well, tell the doc that we are extremely thankful. I think that the information he got there will be very useful.</text> 
 </string> 






 <string id="nnnnnikz_0"> 
 <text>I think I found the knife.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="nnnnnikz_1"> 
 <text>Yes, that's it! Thank you, you've helped me a lot.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="nnnnnikz_2"> 
 <text>You wanted to share information related to someone I'm looking for, right?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="nnnnnikz_01"> 
 <text>Alright... You're looking for Strelok, right? Long story short, I heard from some stalker at the bar who was wearing some worn-out coat that Strelok had stashes all around the Zone. He supposedly had one at Med-Pribor and here, in the Rostok underground. Our boys are currently diggin' there and it is possible that the part of the tunnel that was closed before is now accessible. </text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="nloudmoth_0"> 
 <text>Is there any work you want done?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="nloudmoth_1"> 
 <text>Yes. You need to find a knife in the Rostok underground that my friend lost. After you took care of that bloodsucker, stalkers began swarming the place looking for all kinds of shit. My friend was one of them and he lost the knife in one of the rooms.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="nloudmoth_2"> 
 <text>I'll go take a look. What about payment?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="nloudmoth_01"> 
 <text>I heard you're looking for someone. I think you'll find what I know useful. Bring me the knife, and we'll talk about it.</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="loudmoth_0"> 
 <text>How are you, stalker? Were you the one who sent that SOS message?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="loudmoth_1"> 
 <text>Yes, I need help... Fuck, I barely escaped from that military base. There's no military there.. Those "people" there aren't even human!</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="loudmoth_2"> 
 <text>What do you mean?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="loudmoth_01"> 
 <text>I was going to the Bar with some friends. They followed us... And somehow they knocked us out. We were taken to their base, and they impaled my friend Seryoga on a pole. Someone who looked like their leader performed some sort of a ritual... I can't forget that terrible sight. I still feel sick thinking about it.</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="device_pda_uchenyh_deadcity_desc"> 
 <text>The last PDA's last entry: - "Damn, the military is conducting a raid, and they're leaving no stone unturned." There is also information about the psy-installations at lake Yantar, the marshes, and Pripyat in the PDA's memory card. There are also mentions of a "Black Monolith" project, but detailed information is encrypted.</text> 
 </string>


 <string id="duudpomosnikz_0"> 
 <text>I think I found a group of scientists in the city.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="duudpomosnikz_1"> 
 <text>What about them? Are they ok?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="duudpomosnikz_2"> 
 <text>Well, no. They're dead. It seems that they hid in the attic of one of the houses when the city was being swept by military stalkers. Here, they had this PDA.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="duudpomosnikz_01"> 
 <text>Well, okay. Thank you. Talk to our junior assistant. He might have some work for you... Damn it, our groups have had nothing but trouble lately.</text> 
 </string> 



 <string id="zuudpomosnikz_0"> 
 <text>Do you have any work for me?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zuudpomosnikz_1"> 
 <text>Nah... Or wait, actually yeah, I do. A week ago a group of our men went to Shining Path to study some anomalies there and disappeared. I don't have anyone to send to rescue them, but you appear to be experienced. You'll need to find them, or their bodies, and find the results of their studies, if there any. </text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zuudpomosnikz_2"> 
 <text>OK. I'll try to find them.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zuudpomosnikz_01"> 
 <text>If you find anything bring it here, to the bunker.</text> 
 </string> 
 



 <string id="dpomosnikz_0"> 
 <text>Hey, take a look. It's this one, isn't it?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dpomosnikz_1"> 
 <text>What? You... You found it?! Where?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dpomosnikz_2"> 
 <text>One guy gave it to me. It doesn't matter. Take it. I see that this thing is very precious to you.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="dpomosnikz_01"> 
 <text>Stalker... I'm at a loss of words! Thank you! I'll tell the professor to let you in right away!</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="pomosnikz_0"> 
 <text>Greetings.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pomosnikz_1"> 
 <text>Huh? What do you want? The Professor isn't accepting visitors today. Turn around and get out of here!</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pomosnikz_2"> 
 <text>Calm down, Barkeep sent me here. Why are you so nervous?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pomosnikz_3"> 
 <text>What?! Uh... she... she's gone, don't you get it?! She's completely gone... she disappeared in that damn lab in the Dark Valley! Ah, if I could only find the pendant that I gave her... A silver one...</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pomosnikz_4"> 
 <text>...</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="prpozsskayb_0"> 
 <text>Ok, I think this is the place.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="prpozsskayb_1"> 
 <text>Yup. Thanks for your help, Messer. Here's your suit, you've earned it.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="prpozsskayb_2"> 
 <text>Thanks.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="prpozsskayb_01"> 
 <text>Oh and by the way, you see that guy? That's the main assistant. He's a bit unhinged, so remember to treat him nicely. His wife died recently... She got a pendant from him some time ago, but they didn't find it near her body. She died in some lab at the Valley... Now he dreams of that pendant... Kinda  creepy, huh? Anyways, once again, thanks for your help!</text> 
 </string> 





 <string id="pozsskayb_0"> 
 <text>Greetings, Zyablikov? What's going on?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pozsskayb_1"> 
 <text>Hello. Listen, Messer, would you lead me to the camp? I can show you the way.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pozsskayb_2"> 
 <text>Alright, let's go.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="pozsskayb_01"> 
 <text>Great! When we get there I'll give you one of the suits.</text> 
 </string> 




 <string id="zsskayb_0"> 
 <text>Here's the documents.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zsskayb_1"> 
 <text>Uh huh... huh... I don't understand anything! What laboratory? He's alive? Why didn't nobody tell us? What is going on here?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zsskayb_2"> 
 <text>Calm down, doc. What about my suit?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zsskayb_01"> 
 <text>Sorry, I guess I got a bit carried away. It's time to go back to Yantar. Come to the mobile lab for your suit.</text> 
 </string> 




      <string id="zcddaqiyorbar_0"> 
 <text>Greetings. What's that suit you're wearing? Did you get it from the eggheads?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zcddaqiyorbar_1"> 
 <text>Yes, it's a scientific suit. Fully waterproof. It can protect from even the worst chemical anomalies! Want one? I'll get you one if you do something for me.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zcddaqiyorbar_2"> 
 <text>What do you want?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="zcddaqiyorbar_3"> 
 <text>Me and my brother used to work in the factory. His name was Vania. One time we got into an argument over a petty issue. I got really angry and ran away for a long time. When I finally came back, I learned that the entire complex was evacuated. But here's the catch - Vania didn't come back home. The administration tried to play us like a damn fiddle - they said that he either escaped, or died on duty. Basically, they lied like the devil. The entire family has gone nuts. Then I got a letter from the Research Institute with an offer to take part in an expedition to the Zone. More specifically - to protect it. I wanted to deny the offer, but I've heard that the complex is also in the Zone, and I have nothing to lose. Long story short - if you go to the Rostok plant and find anything that mentions my brother or maybe even him, I'll give you my suit. Are you up for it?</text>

 </string> 
 <string id="cddaqiyorbar_1"> 
 <text>Yes, I do. Behind the Rostok plant, near the dam, is some sort of living area. A Kamaz truck sits there. I want it brought here, but nobody wants to do it. </text>

 <string id="cddaqiyorbar_2"> 
 <text>I can try to do it.</text>

 </string>
 <string id="cddaqiyorbar_4"> 
 <text>OK.</text> 
 </string>



 <string id="casskayb_0"> 
 <text>I brought the truck.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="casskayb_1"> 
 <text>Great job, here's your reward. Is the truck alright? Does it have any cargo left inside? Or maybe something else happened?</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="casskayb_2"> 
 <text>No, everything is all right... Except, there was a bloodsucker... It probably came from Rostok..</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="casskayb_01"> 
 <text>Alrighty then. I'll get someone to put the truck at the 'parking lot'. Thanks for your help, Messer.</text>

 </string> 
 <string id="skayb_1"> 
 <text>Yeah, imagine this - some Freedomers in Rostok found 10 crates full of bolts! But these aren't regular bolts, they're radioactive bolts...  Basically, this should've been brought outside the perimeter a long time ago, but there's some delays with the delivery and shit, so I'm keeping them safe. And about these artifacts - I managed to synthesize them some time ago. I had a portable transmutator, and I still have some recipes in my PDA. If you're interested, talk to our leader at the mobile bunker in Yantar.</text>

 </string> 
 <string id="iyorbar_2"> 
 <text>Well, mostly. I am feeling a bit off, but I'm alive, and that's what counts. I don't think I'm going to become a zombie that's going to eat your brains anytime soon.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="iyorbar_3"> 
 <text>That's great. Let's get to the point: you plan on going to the center of the Zone, right? I've got something that might be of interest to you. Duty has an "Igla" missile launcher; in the Zone, these are extremely rare. Other stalkers want it, so they keep it under lock and key. If you do a certain job for Duty, you'll get it for free. You need to go to Rostok. There's a warehouse, and on the roof, there's a man from Duty there. Talk to him, and decide if you want to do the job. Simple enough, right? If you do it, the the reward will be worth it.</text>

 <text>I see you're not the average stalker, Witcher. Alright, I'll go do it.</text>

	    <text>When one of the first major expeditions was sent to the Zone, which included scientists and a military detachment, no one at that time knew what the outcome would be. The expedition failed, and one of the military generals, General Tachenko, founded "Duty". Many of his comrades died, so he vowed to destroy the Zone, which he regarded as a plague.

 <text>Hello there! I haven't seen you around here before. I suppose you came here from the Garbage? Ha, ha! Of course you did! What a silly question. Listen, do you want to earn some money?</text>

 <string id="serbar_1"> 
 <text>Sure. I could use some money.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="serbar_2"> 
 <text>I'll tell you what's going on. I had planned on going on a raid to the Medpribor Institute with someone - a newcomer. He agreed to carry a backpack with the loot for me while I watch our asses on the way back. I sent him to the apartment block opposite of mine so he could rest up while I go do some business during the night. I just woke up, but I haven't seen or heard from him. I'm worried. Do you want to help me check things out? I'll cover you in there if you decide to help.</text>

      <string id="carbar_0"> 
 <text>I'd like to buy a car.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="carbar_1"> 
 <text>No problem. I've got several vehicles for sale.\n \nZaphorozets - 1000 rubles. It's a bit beaten up, but it works. It's in a garage on the Bar territory.\n \nMoskvich - 2000 rubles. Some stalkers managed to bring this from Pripyat. It's nearly brand new! It's at Yantar in the car hangar. \n \nKamaz - 8000 rubles. This is a biggie. It's a solid vehicle, and it has good handling. It's on Bar territory. \n \nLada - 5000 rubles. You'll hit 130 on the road, but don't expect that kind of speed offroad. Also on Bar territory, in one of the garages. \n \nAnd the BTR - 15000 rubles. Don't ask where I got it from. It's on Bar territory. \n \nWhat do you choose? But first, show me that you've got enough money. If you don't have anything, then there's nothing to talk about.</text>

 <string id="carbar_2"> 
 <text>Gimme the Zaphorozets.</text>

The stalker who occupied it disappeared a long time ago, I haven't heard of him in years. Here, take the key, you can live there. I haven't been in that house since it's owner disappeared, either way I don't need it and you've done a great thing. Take it. Ah, I've almost forgot: the leader of Duty wants to see you.</text>

		<text>So, your first fight? Your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. He's here because of debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. He's gonna fight like a cornered animal. Equipment for today... lemme think... OK! Why don't you two use PMm's...two clips each should be plenty. Either you kick his arse or we feed you to the dogs - not much of a choice. Go on now.</text>

		<text>Your last fight didn't mean shit. You're still the same piece of meat you were before and no self-respecting person will bet a single mag on you. If you wanna earn some proper cash you're gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. Your new opponent also got through the first round and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I don't like him, to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd doesn't like that. So, go and show us what you can do! The stakes will increase after this fight - all you gotta do is stay alive. Move it!</text>

		<text>Well, well... You're not as much of a pussy as you first seemed. Now it's time to test you out in a real fight. You're up against two guys. The first one's called Swede and I don't remember the second one's name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team - they're more likely to shoot each other. Today is rifle day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are ten to one so if you win you'll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

		<text>Well, now I can safely say that you're a fighter, a real fighter. Now it's time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies - two brothers - on your side. They haven't fought yet but they're brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him. Good luck, pal... you're gonna need it.</text>

		<text>You've got a special fight today. Even the army has heard about you! Don't be surprised, they fight here too - there's even a general in the crowd. These guys are from the Spetsnaz or from OMON. They're well armed and their armor is good as you'd expect. Don't worry though, I ain't gonna leave you out in the rain, either. You'll get a vest used by Freedom - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took 'em at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, they'll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They're not well-armed - just a few pistols and sawn-offs - but there's six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

		<text>Well, you're almost in the final. Now you'll be fighting a real stalker. He's alone but he's got an FN2000 and he's inside an exoskeleton. Catch one burst and you're toast. There will be a surprise that I can't tell you about too... Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, go!</text>

There will be four other stalkers in the arena: all real pros in exoskeletons with H&amp;K G36s but it's a fair deal this time - you'll get exactly what they have.

		<text>As you probably know by now, some government organisations are studying the "nature" of the Zone. Rumors say, that them and their experiments caused the Zone itself to appear. Strelok and his crew tried to find out more about the Zone, but he and his entire crew disappeared. I don't know the truth, I only can guess. Government organisations put mobile laboratories around the Zone, isolated metallic bunkers protected by stalkers. These bunkers are self sufficient and able to work for a couple of months on their own. We keep in touch with one of these bunkers at Yantar. The eggheads are pretty okay guys, they'll share some info, and we help them in times of need. Works for both of us.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111">
		<text>This legend is about the Monolith, which may be what caused the Zone to appear. When the Zone exploded in 2006, they evacuated people living near it and the Zone itself was cordoned off by the Army. Everyone was panicking, nobody knew what was going on, the Zone was expanding and the field labs couldn't do anything! Loads of people died there. Everyone was afraid of the radiation which could affect half of Europe. After a few years had passed, some reckless guys like you appeared. They called themselves stalkers. They started to sneak past army cordons believing that there are things in the Zone that would make them rich. Bit by bit, they brought out weird things, artifacts and which eventually turned out a race for them. Scientists went after them like crazy. They paid fantastic money for just one trinket back then, not like now.</text>

		<text>After a while, the first tales and legends about what's deep inside the Zone by the tumbledown nuclear power plant started to circulate. It was also then that one of the veterans told us the story of Monolith that allegedly grants your wishes. You should have seen the hysteria: experienced, level-headed men started trying to break through to the center - everyone wanted something from the Monolith. We got some morbid details about the first stalker who made it through to the Monolith...</text>

		<text>When the Zone had just appeared many people were trapped inside and cut off from the outside world. Most of them died pretty quickly but there were a few lucky survivors who tried to do something about it. One of these survivors found himself by the station and noticed some strange light inside. With no way back he decided to try to get closer. He saw the broken roof of the sarcophagus and the light coming out through it. He climbed up the wall and looked inside. Among the debris of metal and molten concrete there lay a massive black rock. It was the Monolith. The stalker managed to shake off the "spell" and realised that he had climbed very close to the sarcophagus, which was highly radioactive. He was scared to death but through the fear he could sense the Monolith calling to him. The Monolith called to him and he came to see strange, unbelievable things about the Monolith inside his head...</text>

		<text>I don't know what's true in this story and what's not but the point is the guy made a wish which came true, while the Zone grew by 5 kilometers. It seems the Zone gobbles up more land for every wish that is granted... But that ain't gonna stop hotshots like you.

	<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_1">
		<text>Sure, no problem! Freedom is one of the oldest groups in the Zone and the only one that openly opposes government troops and research teams. Its founders are dead - they were killed during a big bloodbath after the army dropped a large assault force in the Zone but the ability to control the Zone from outside was destroyed at the same time. There is some evidence to suggest that the first Zone was used as a secret army weapons' testing site . If that's true, they must have used some powerful shit.Anyway, what was I saying...? Oh yeah, Freedom is the only group that is trying to stop the government from gaining control over the testing site again. God knows what will happen if they start testing their shit again, so Freedom is trying to hold out at all costs.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_3">
		<text>Duty is basically controlled from the outside by the government. Their current objective is to clear the territory of mutants and destroy Freedom, which is what they are doing at the moment. When the time is right, they will drop a large assault force in the Zone and take control of the area.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_visitors_10_start_7111">
		<text>Useful to a rookie? Well, listen up. To the North, not far from the Brain Scorcher, Freedom have set up their HQ in an old military base. They're notorious nihilists, anarchists and criminals - freedom fighters, freaking guerrillas all of them. All they do is sabotage research groups, attack army units and constantly skirmish with Duty. These skirmishes are now spilling over into a small-scale war for survival. Let me give you some advice: never get involved with them. They'll only accept you if you're totally crazy and there's a reward on your head. Ha-ha-ha. Can you believe that?</text>

		<text>Well, there used to be this group led by Strelok. There were all sorts of legends about it going around the Zone...good and bad, but few people really knew the truth. The truth is that they wanted to deal with the Zone, find out what created it. That's why military stalkers were after them but they didn't know where to look. The government didn't want normal stalkers to know things they shouldn't have known. One day Strelok found something really important and made a move towards the center of the Zone with some of his boys. Half of the group died on the way but the rest made it through... What happened to them there - no one knows. Looks like they've copped it. The other group members were caught and killed off... I don't think there are any of them left now. Sad story, eh?</text>

I panicked and said that we should leave everything and go back. Hunchback managed to pull himself together and said that we had to get Spotty out... I said "You're an idiot, don't you wanna live? It's over for him, how are we gonna carry him all the way back?" Just as he managed to convince me and started to climb down to get Spotty... another wave came.

		<text>Traders say that there's a real treasure trove of artifacts in the center of the Zone, so anyone who makes it through will make enough money for two lifetimes. Personally, I think there's more to this. Obviously the traders think about their own interests, but there are strange rumours going around. Apparently, there's something better than artifacts there - something that ain't from this world, something alien or from another dimension altogether! They call it the Wish-granting machine. I heard a legend about a stalker who made it through. Only every time someone makes a wish the Zone grows and nobody who gets there uses his wish to make it disappear.

		<text>Before the accident in '86 this was an industrial area. As you can see, there ain't much left of it now... In the basement by the hangar you'll find the 100 Rads bar. The place is run by the local trader who doubles up as a barman. If you want to trade, talk, get a mission or find out the latest news, that's the place to go. There's also the Arena where you can fight and make some cash. Duty's base is not far from the Arena. If you want to join Duty go straight over there - they'll tell you who to speak to. Oh, by the way, all of this area is protected by Duty so behave and keep your weapons holstered. If you start shooting, the patrol will "calm you down" pretty quickly.</text>

		<text>My name is Kruglov. I am a professor of biology, I study the Zone. Yesterday, for example, I found an animal of particular interest - Antropomorphus Dendromutantus Vulgaris. I mostly find and document new species of mutant animals, their traits and distinctive features. The information is then thoroughly studied and transferred to the outside world. Some of it, of course, goes to the Barkeep. My discoveries have helped to save the lives of many stalkers.

		<text>The Zone is a wonderful gift to humanity. Of course normal existence here is not possible due to the high radiation levels, and aggressive mutants. All of these things are obviously extremely dangerous but they are also things of great scientific value. The Zone is almost a natural experiment, a treasure for scientists! The extent to which humanity's knowledge could be increased through the study of the Zone is unfathomable. Technology, medicine, new plants- medical and edible, biotechnology, cures for incurable diseases...anything! Perhaps we can solve the food problem for the entire planet. If people didn't interfere, science could lead humanity into a new Golden Era!</text>

What a joke! The problem is that these children play their games with real weapons and cause death. Childish people are often annoyed about the fact that someone doesn't share everything with them, including information that is not meant for them. There are no limits in the use of force. They shoot without thinking and kill those who study the Zone. They believe that this information will allow them to open the way to the center of the Zone.
